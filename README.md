This website **brings with it a simple, structured layout, but which in fact combines colors and themes**, in relation to the *2022 world cup*, which takes place in November, in Qatar.

## About â“‚

The following technologies **were used to create** the website:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jquery
- FontAwesome
- Bootstrap
- Slick js

- Swal (Sweet alert)

All these *technologies* can be found while reading the code, all of them were studied and analyzed during the construction of this site. 
The same is online on the internet, and can be accessed of anywhere, even in **Qatar** ðŸ˜„.

The site uses its own layout, created by me, based on old projects and sites with similar themes. 
The choice of colors and fonts and media were selected having the main theme of the work, the **2022 World Cup in Qatar**.
